    <h2>🚘 About NeonDrive</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>NeonDrive</strong>, we don’t just build cars — we forge dreams in chrome, carbon, and questionable budget constraints. Whether you're a billionaire with taste or a broke college student with ambition, we deliver futuristic electric vehicles designed around <em>your</em> budget. Hover tires? Optional. Working brakes? We'll see what we can do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission? Simple: <strong>make sci-fi cars on sitcom money</strong>. You bring the cash, we bring the glow.

        <h3>Patrick – The Tech Guy 💻</h3>
        <p>
          Code wizard. Electricity whisperer. Christ lover. Patrick once got a server to run on a potato — and we still use it to host our backend. If it plugs in, blinks, or explodes when touched, Patrick’s your man. TBH we won't have a project without him.

        <h3>Remi – The Billionaire Investor 💰</h3>
        <p>
          Nobody really knows where Remi got his money. We don't ask, he doesn't tell. He funds the dreams, critiques the color schemes, and insists every car have a champagne dispenser.(He was too cheap to fix this page after a fallout with Redacted, that's why Redeacted is Redacted) Bro is pennywise.
